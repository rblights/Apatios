                    <summary><h3>Q: How much does a [Kitchen/Bathroom/Basement] remodel cost?</h3></summary>
                    <p>A: Remodeling costs vary significantly based on the scope of work, materials selected, and the complexity of the design. We provide transparent, detailed estimates after our initial consultation, ensuring you understand exactly where your investment goes. We aim to work within your budget while delivering exceptional value.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Q: How long does a typical remodel take?</h3></summary>
                    <p>A: Project timelines depend on the size and complexity. A bathroom remodel might take 2-4 weeks, while a kitchen could be 6-10 weeks, and a whole-home renovation even longer. We provide a projected timeline in your proposal and keep you updated on progress, accounting for unforeseen circumstances.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Q: Are you licensed and insured?</h3></summary>
                    <p>A: Absolutely. APATIOS is fully licensed, bonded, and insured in Oregon. We carry comprehensive liability insurance and workers' compensation, protecting both our team and your property. We are happy to provide proof of insurance upon request.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Q: Do I need to get permits? If so, who handles them?</h3></summary>
                    <p>A: Most significant remodeling projects (especially those involving structural changes, plumbing, or electrical work) require permits from your local municipality. We handle the entire permitting process for you, ensuring all work complies with local building codes and regulations.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary><h3>Q: Can I live in my home during the renovation?</h3></summary>
                    <p>A: For many projects (like single-room remodels), living in your home is feasible, though there will be some disruption. For larger projects (whole-home remodels, extensive additions), temporary relocation might be recommended for your comfort and safety. We’ll discuss this during planning.</p>
                </details>

                <details>

                    <p>A: Our commitment to satisfaction is threefold: clear communication, quality craftsmanship, and a client-first approach. We listen, plan meticulously, execute precisely, and conduct thorough walkthroughs to ensure the final result meets or exceeds your expectations. We're not finished until you're thrilled.</p>

We're happy to discuss specific material choices and their benefits during our design phase.</p>
